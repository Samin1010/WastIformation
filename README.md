Hello. Thanks for taking a look at my very first project.
This was for our Studio 1 course at RMIT. Me and Abbazs were placed together in a group and we delivered our best in the given timeframe. We were actually very proud of this as our first project and even got wonderful remarks from our assessor.

So what is this about?

The website is built to deliver data retrieved from a database made from given csv files. The aim is to provide a usable and well-designed UI and search functions to retrieve required data.
